# Supabase setup for the web admin

This repository keeps the member hymnal static and offline-capable. The admin page uses Supabase Auth and an admin-only database; it does not use a service-role key.

## One-time setup

1. In Supabase, rotate/revoke any secret or service-role keys that have been exposed. Never place those keys in this repository or the browser.
2. Open the project's SQL Editor and run `migrations/202610090001_admin_backend.sql`.
3. In Authentication, invite or create the administrator account. Require email confirmation.
4. In the SQL Editor, grant the confirmed account admin access:

   ```sql
   select public.grant_admin_by_email('your-admin-email@example.org');
   ```

   Replace the example with the approved admin email. The email is intentionally not stored in this public repository.
5. Open the admin URL and sign in. The first authorized sign-in imports the existing repository hymn collection once, if the database is empty.

The browser uses only the Supabase project URL and a publishable key. Row-level security denies unauthenticated access and checks the `admin_users` table for every admin-data operation. Do not disable RLS or add a service-role/secret key to client-side files.

## Existing data and scope

The initial import preserves the repository's existing hymn numbers, English/Yoruba fields, categories, and lyric sources. It does not change the bundled public website or Android app. Admin edits are stored in Supabase; publishing them to the public web/mobile experience is a later phase.
